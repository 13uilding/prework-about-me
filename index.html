      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Warm greetings and jolly times to you sir or madam. I am 27 year old male looking forward to experiencing and learning during the next 12 weeks in this coding camp. I have studied before, and I obtained a BS in Physics from the University of Utah with a minor in Math and Philosophy. I enjoy big ideas, and I have a great appreciation for things that are both concise and complex. I worked a little over a year as a Control's Technician before deciding to change my career. I wanted a profession that focused more on software, continuous learning, and fellowship. I hope to make friends and face challenges while taking my first steps in this dynamic field.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Michigan and lived there for 8 years. I then moved to Washington, Nevada, Utah, Philippines, Wyoming, and finally Colorado. I have lived in many places, and I wouldn't consider myself from anyone of these places in particular. I consider myself a mutt in this regard.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Philosophy, learning, Dota 2, consuming entertainment, hiking, and sports if I can find a group of people to play with.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I am not positive what exactly is my dream job, but I have some requisites. For example, I want to be part of a team that does hard work without complaining and blaming others. I want to tackle complex issues with these people with elegant concise code.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I just moved in with my sister in Arvada to attend this coding camp.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to do something difficult and worthwhile. The web is the modern frontier, and I want to be a part of it.</p>
